## Description of the Project (300 words)
TWRK: Together We Work is a website platform that provides a matchmaking service for selecting group mates in any situation needed. Whether for a personal project or for competitions.  We try to solve the problem of online learning where it is hard to connect with people and find people who share the same interest and skillsets needed when doing a group project. Therefore we come in an all-in-one platform to solve all your group project needs.
