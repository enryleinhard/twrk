## Description of the Project (300 words)
TWRK: Together We Work is a website platform that provides a matchmaking service for selecting group mates in any situation needed. Whether for a personal project or for competitions.  We try to solve the problem of online learning where it is hard to connect with people and find people who share the same interest and skillsets needed when doing a group project. Therefore we come in an all-in-one platform to solve all your group project needs. 

TWRK: Together We Work is made with Vue.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Python

We use machine-learning based matchmaking to best suit our users’ interest and help them match with the projects. User’s data input about projects preference and user’s skills were collected through the initial personalization to be processed by a content-based recommender system.

## 2. Explore Page and Project Feed

To discover other users’ project, we provide a feed page where our user can browse through others’ work and find project inspirations.

## 3. Built-in Task Oriented Feature
